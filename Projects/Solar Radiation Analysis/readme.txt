This project pertained to Africa Improved Food, a food processing industry. Its objective was to assess the solar irradiance reaching their location to ascertain its suitability for constructing a solar power facility capable of supplying energy to the industry. My role was to perform data analysis and provide a decision on whether this industry should or should not construct a solar power plant. The data used was daily data that was collected for the period of two years. 

I used a computer program called Jupyter notebook with Python and its libraries such as NumPy, Pandas for data manipulation and analysis as well as generating visualizations using python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. By analyzing multiple factors including weather data, geographical coordinates, time of day, and day of the year, the project utilized solar geometry calculations to estimate different components of solar radiation, including clear-sky Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), clear-sky Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI), and clear-sky Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI). The primary objective was to determine the average irradiance levels for specific time periods or seasons at the target location. 

The findings were presented in the visualizations, which indicate that the specific location under study receives solar radiation from 5:00 AM to 6:00 PM, with the peak sun hours occurring between 10:00 AM and 3:00 PM. With the peak sun hours of almost 5 hours, this work concluded that the solar power plant could be built and supply electrical energy to  the industry.
